What is this

This is a tool to perform the operations of a 4 function calculator with arbitrary string inputs.



Why does this exist

This a  project to show my familiarity with different User Interface Frameworks
**(React.JS, Angular.JS, Vue.JS, WPF, HTML/CSS, MAUI, GODOT)** . 
I chose calculators in particular because it is a simple piece of technology we all understand. 
However, when building a tool to handle arbitrary string inputs, it can get very difficult very quickly.

How does it work
-
When a string input is given, it will be broken down to its operands and operators using PEMDAS rules to perform operations.

Limitations
-
1. It only supports integers
